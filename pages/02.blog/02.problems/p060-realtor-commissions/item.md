Two realtors discuss who's netting the award for most commissions, but it isn't clear who the winner is...

# Problem statement

Alice and Bob are two realtors that work at the same premium real estate agency, WSH.
Because WSH really wants to focus on selling premium properties,
they instated a monetary prize that is awarded every two years to the realtor that has the highest average commission over the past two years.

The award for the years 2020 and 2021 is being attributed soon.
One day, at the office, Alice overheard Bob gloating:

 > “I can't wait to get my money! I already know what I'll be doing with it!”

Alice turned to Bob and asked:

 > “How can you be so sure that you are the one netting the prize?”

Bob smirked and returned:

 > “I guess you haven't been paying attention, Alice!
 > In 2020 I was the realtor with the highest average commission over that year...
 > And in 2021 I did it again!”

Alice smiled and returned to work.

Who do you think is right?
Is Bob definitely getting the award?
Or is there a scenario in which Alice gets the prize?

!!! Give it some thought!
