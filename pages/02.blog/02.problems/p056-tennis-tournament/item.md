# Problem statement

Suppose that $n$ players are going to play in a tennis tournament.
The players will be randomly assigned to [brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket_(tournament)),
and each bracket plays a match.
The winner of each match advances to the next bracket,
until the two final players face each other in the final match,
which determines the winner.

As a function of the number of players $n$,
how many matches are needed to determine the winner of the tournament?

!!! Give it some thought!
