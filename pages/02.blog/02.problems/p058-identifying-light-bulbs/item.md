Please help me identify these 100 light bulbs by turning ON and OFF their switches.

# Problem statement

I have a very peculiar room in my house.
It's a simple room that doesn't have much decoration.
However, I do have 100 light bulbs hanging from the ceiling because I thought it would look cool.
When I installed the 100 light bulbs I wanted maximum freedom,
so I also installed 100 independent switches:

 - each switch controls exactly one light bulb; and
 - each light bulb is controlled by exactly one switch.

Of course I was completely silly, so I installed the switches in a room that is far from the room with the light bulbs **and** I completely forgot which light switch controls which light bulb.
How can I identify which switch controls which light bulb in the _least amount of trips_ possible?

For example, I could flip ON a switch and then go verify which light bulb turned ON,
and I could do this for the 100 light bulbs...
But that would take me 100 trips.

!!! Give it some thought!
