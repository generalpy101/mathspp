# Problem statement

Suppose you have a circle, like the one in the figure below.
At your disposal, you have a compass, a straightedge
(like a ruler, but without length ticks),
and a pencil.

Can you find the centre of the circle with just five lines?
(Every time you use the compass counts as one line,
and every time you use the straightedge counts as another line.)

!!! Give it some thought!

If you need any clarification whatsoever, feel free to ask in the comment section below.
